# Service Principal Credential Manager

## Overview
The Service Principal Credential Manager is a critical enterprise security automation that monitors, assesses, and manages Azure Service Principal credentials at scale. This automation addresses one of the most common security risks in Azure environments: expired or poorly managed Service Principal credentials that can lead to service disruptions or security vulnerabilities.

## Mission Statement
Provide proactive, automated Service Principal credential lifecycle management to prevent security incidents, reduce operational overhead, and ensure compliance with enterprise security policies.

## Core Functionality

### 🔍 Credential Discovery & Analysis
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Discovers all Service Principals across the Azure AD tenant
- **Credential Inventory**: Catalogs both certificate and secret-based credentials
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitors creation dates, expiration dates, and credential age
- **Usage Analysis**: Correlates credential usage with Azure audit logs to identify unused credentials

### 🚨 Risk Assessment & Prioritization
- **Multi-Factor Risk Scoring**: Evaluates credentials based on expiration status, usage patterns, credential type, and age
- **Risk Categories**:
  - **Critical**: Expired credentials on unused applications (highest security risk)
  - **High**: Expired credentials on active applications, or credentials expiring within 7 days
  - **Medium**: Long-lived secrets (>365 days), credentials expiring within 30 days
  - **Low**: Well-managed credentials with proper rotation schedules

### 📊 Enterprise Reporting & Analytics
- **Executive Dashboards**: High-level security posture summaries for leadership
- **Detailed CSV Reports**: Comprehensive credential inventories for security teams
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical tracking of credential health and compliance metrics
- **Compliance Reporting**: SOC2/SOX compliance documentation with audit trails

### 🔧 Automated Remediation (Optional)
- **Safe Credential Cleanup**: Automatically disables expired credentials on confirmed unused applications
- **Renewal Workflows**: Orchestrates credential rotation for critical applications
- **Integration Hooks**: Supports integration with DevOps pipelines for automated certificate deployment

## Security Architecture

### Permission Requirements
This automation requires the following Microsoft Graph API permissions:
- **Application.Read.All**: Read Service Principal and Application objects
- **Application.ReadWrite.All**: Enable automated remediation capabilities (optional)
- **Directory.Read.All**: Access directory information for comprehensive analysis
- **AuditLog.Read.All**: Analyze sign-in patterns to determine credential usage
- **Mail.Send**: Send security alerts and compliance reports

### Fail-Fast Security Validation
Following enterprise security patterns, the script implements fail-fast permission validation:

```powershell
if (-not $PermissionsValid) {
    $ErrorMessage = @"
CRITICAL ERROR: Missing required Microsoft Graph permissions.

Required permissions:
$(($RequiredPermissions | ForEach-Object { "  - $_" }) -join "`n")

To fix this:
1. Go to Azure Portal → App Registrations → [Your App]
2. Navigate to API Permissions
3. Add the missing Microsoft Graph permissions (Application type)
4. Click 'Grant admin consent'
5. Re-run this script

Cannot proceed safely without proper permissions.
"@
    Write-Error $ErrorMessage
    throw "Missing required Microsoft Graph permissions. Cannot continue safely."
}
```

### Authentication Patterns
- **Production**: Managed Identity authentication (recommended)
- **Testing**: Environment variables (`$env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `$env:AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `$env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- **Never**: Hardcoded credentials (blocked by pre-commit hooks)

## Risk Assessment Algorithm

### Risk Calculation Logic
```powershell
# Critical Risk Factors
- Expired credentials on unused applications (immediate security risk)
- Expired credentials on active applications (service disruption risk)

# High Risk Factors  
- Credentials expiring within 7 days
- Long-lived secrets without rotation (>365 days)

# Medium Risk Factors
- Credentials expiring within 30 days
- Secret-type credentials older than 90 days
- Multiple risk factors combined

# Low Risk
- Well-managed credentials with proper rotation schedules
- Certificate-based authentication with reasonable lifespans
```

### Business Impact Assessment
The automation provides business context for each risk:
- **Service Disruption Potential**: Active applications with expiring credentials
- **Security Exposure**: Unused applications with expired access
- **Compliance Gaps**: Credentials violating enterprise rotation policies
- **Cost Optimization**: Unused applications consuming licenses or resources

## Implementation Patterns for AI Agents

### Core Security Patterns
1. **Fail-Fast Validation**: Always validate permissions before proceeding with business logic
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Provide clear, actionable error messages with specific fix instructions
3. **Safe Defaults**: Enable WhatIf mode by default, require explicit confirmation for destructive actions
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all credential analysis and remediation actions for compliance

### Data Processing Patterns
```powershell
# Efficient batch processing for large tenants
$ProcessedCount = 0
foreach ($SP in $ServicePrincipals) {
    $ProcessedCount++
    if ($ProcessedCount % 50 -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "Processed $ProcessedCount/$($ServicePrincipals.Count) Service Principals..." -ForegroundColor Gray
    }
    # Process credential analysis...
}
```

### Risk Assessment Patterns
```powershell
# Multi-factor risk assessment with business context
$RiskFactors = @()
if ($Credential.IsExpired) { $RiskFactors += "Expired" }
if ($Credential.DaysUntilExpiry -le $CriticalThresholdDays) { $RiskFactors += "Expires Soon" }
if ($Credential.CredentialAge -gt $LongLivedThresholdDays) { $RiskFactors += "Long-Lived" }
if ($IsUnused) { $RiskFactors += "Unused" }

# Determine overall risk level based on combination of factors
$Credential.RiskLevel = if ($Credential.IsExpired -and $IsUnused) { "Critical" }
                       elseif ($Credential.IsExpired -or $Credential.DaysUntilExpiry -le $CriticalThresholdDays) { "High" }
                       elseif ($RiskFactors.Count -ge 2) { "Medium" }
                       else { "Low" }
```
