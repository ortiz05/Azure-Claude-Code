## Technical Architecture

### Azure Resources Required
- Azure Storage Account (StorageV2 with cool access tier)
- Resource Group with proper RBAC permissions
- Azure Automation Account with system-assigned managed identity

### üöÄ CRITICAL: Azure Storage Deployment Workflow

**MANDATORY 3-STEP DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE** (Run manually by administrator):

#### Step 1: Create Deployment Group
```powershell
# Creates Azure AD group and assigns RBAC permissions to resource group
./Automation-Logging-Storage-Setup/Azure-Automation/Create-AutomationStorageDeploymentGroup.ps1 `
    -TenantId "your-tenant-id" `
    -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" `
    -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group"
```
**Purpose**: Creates security group with necessary Azure RBAC permissions on the resource group

#### Step 2: Grant Storage Permissions to Managed Identity
```powershell
# Grants Azure Storage permissions to the Automation Account's managed identity
./Automation-Logging-Storage-Setup/Azure-Automation/Grant-AutomationStoragePermissions.ps1 `
    -ManagedIdentityObjectId "managed-identity-object-id" `
    -TenantId "your-tenant-id" `
    -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" `
    -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group"
```
**Purpose**: Assigns required Azure Storage permissions for automation logging operations

#### Step 3: Deploy Storage Infrastructure
```powershell
# Deploys the actual storage account with containers and lifecycle policies
./Automation-Logging-Storage-Setup/Azure-Automation/Deploy-AutomationLoggingStorageSetup.ps1 `
    -TenantId "your-tenant-id" `
    -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" `
    -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group" `
    -AutomationManagedIdentityId "managed-identity-object-id"
```
**Purpose**: Creates the storage infrastructure with all containers, policies, and configurations

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites Validation
Before starting deployment:
- [ ] Resource group exists in target subscription
- [ ] User has Owner or Contributor permissions on the resource group
- [ ] Azure Automation Account exists with system-assigned managed identity enabled
- [ ] Tenant ID is available and validated
- [ ] Storage account name is globally unique

#### ‚úÖ Successful Deployment Record

**Latest Deployment (Template)**:
- **Storage Account**: `autologstore####` (randomly generated)
- **Resource Group**: User-specified
- **Tenant**: User-specified
- **Status**: Ready for configuration

**Deployment Results**:
- ‚úÖ Storage account created with enterprise security settings
- ‚úÖ 8 containers created for different automation services

- **Access Control**: Managed identity and RBAC integration

### Required Azure RBAC Permissions

| Role | Scope | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Storage Account Contributor | Resource Group | Create and manage storage accounts |
| Storage Blob Data Contributor | Resource Group | Read, write, delete containers and blobs |
| Reader | Resource Group | View resource group contents |

### Storage Container Structure

The solution creates the following containers:

| Container Name | Purpose | Automation Service |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| `device-cleanup-reports` | Device cleanup automation outputs | Device Cleanup Automation |
| `mfa-compliance-reports` | MFA compliance monitoring outputs | MFA Compliance Monitor |
| `app-usage-reports` | Application usage analysis reports | Enterprise App Usage Monitor |
| `certificate-monitor-reports` | Certificate expiration monitoring | Enterprise App Certificate Monitor |
| `service-principal-reports` | Service principal management reports | Service Principal Credential Manager |
| `permission-audit-reports` | Permission governance reports | Application Permission Auditor |
| `deployment-logs` | Deployment and configuration logs | All Services |
| `archived-reports` | Long-term storage for old reports | All Services (Automated) |

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Storage Account Configuration
The solution creates a storage account with these specifications:
- **Kind**: StorageV2 (latest generation)
- **Access Tier**: Cool (cost-optimized for infrequent access)
- **Redundancy**: Standard_LRS (locally redundant, cost-effective)
- **Security**: HTTPS-only, TLS 1.2, no public blob access
- **Authentication**: Managed identity preferred, shared key available for compatibility

### 2. Folder Structure Convention
Each container uses this hierarchical structure:
```
container-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service-name-2025-01-15.csv
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service-name-2025-01-15.html
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service-name-log-2025-01-15.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 02/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.txt (documentation)
```

### 3. Lifecycle Management Policies
Automatic cost optimization through:
- **Archive Policy**: Move to cool storage after 90 days
- **Deletion Policy**: Delete after 365 days (configurable)
- **Exception Handling**: Archived-reports container for long-term retention
- **Cost Impact**: Reduces storage costs by ~70% for older reports

### 4. Integration with Automation Scripts
Example PowerShell code for automation runbooks:
```powershell
# Connect to storage using managed identity
$StorageAccountName = "your-storage-account-name"
$Context = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName -UseConnectedAccount

# Upload report with proper folder structure
$ContainerName = "device-cleanup-reports"
$BlobName = "$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy/MM')/device-cleanup-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').csv"
Set-AzStorageBlobContent -File $ReportPath -Container $ContainerName -Blob $BlobName -Context $Context
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Controls
- **Managed Identity**: Primary authentication method for automation scripts
- **RBAC**: Least-privilege access using built-in Azure roles
- **Network Security**: Public access disabled for blob endpoints
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit

### 2. Compliance Features
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic compliance with data retention requirements
- **Audit Trails**: All access logged through Azure Monitor
- **Metadata Tracking**: Container and blob metadata for governance
- **Cost Tracking**: Resource tags for chargeback and monitoring

### 3. Monitoring Recommendations
- Set up Azure Monitor alerts for storage usage and costs
- Configure Log Analytics for access pattern analysis
- Monitor lifecycle policy effectiveness
- Track managed identity authentication success/failure

## Cost Optimization

### 1. Storage Tier Strategy
- **Cool Storage**: Primary tier for automation reports (accessed monthly)
- **Archive Storage**: Automatic transition for old reports (lifecycle policy)
- **Cost Savings**: ~50-70% reduction compared to hot storage

### 2. Retention Policies
- **Default**: 365 days retention, 90 days before archival
- **Configurable**: Adjustable based on compliance requirements
- **Impact**: Automatic cleanup prevents storage cost growth

### 3. Expected Costs (1GB monthly data)
- **Cool Storage**: ~$0.01/month storage + $0.10 transactions = $0.11/month
- **Hot Storage**: ~$0.02/month storage + $0.05 transactions = $0.07/month
- **Archive Storage**: ~$0.002/month storage (after lifecycle transition)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Storage Account Name Conflicts**: Names must be globally unique (3-24 characters, lowercase/numbers)
2. **Permission Issues**: Ensure managed identity has Storage Blob Data Contributor role
3. **Lifecycle Policy Failures**: Check blob access patterns and policy configuration
4. **Cost Increases**: Review retention policies and archive settings

### Validation Steps
1. Verify containers are created successfully
2. Test managed identity access from automation runbook
3. Confirm lifecycle policies are active
4. Check that sample folder structures exist

## Integration with Existing Automations

### 1. Update Automation Scripts
Each existing automation service should be updated to:
- Use the new centralized storage account
- Follow the container naming conventions
- Implement proper folder structure
- Use managed identity authentication

### 2. Recommended Changes
- Replace local CSV exports with blob storage uploads
- Update HTML report generation to include storage links
- Modify email notifications to reference stored reports
- Add error handling for storage operations

### 3. Migration Strategy
1. Deploy storage infrastructure (3-step workflow)
2. Test with one automation service first
3. Gradually migrate other services
4. Decommission old storage methods
5. Monitor costs and adjust policies as needed
