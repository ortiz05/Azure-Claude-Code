# Application Permission Auditor

Enterprise-grade automation for comprehensive application permission governance, compliance monitoring, and over-privilege detection across Microsoft Azure environments.

## üìã Overview

This automation addresses critical enterprise security risks by analyzing Microsoft Graph API permissions across all Enterprise Applications. It identifies over-privileged applications, monitors OAuth consent patterns, and enforces principle of least privilege to prevent security breaches through application permission abuse.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Comprehensive Permission Discovery**
  - Scans all Enterprise Applications and Service Principals
  - Analyzes both Application permissions (app-to-app) and Delegated permissions (user-to-app)
  - Maps OAuth2 permission grants with consent type analysis
  - Identifies permissions across Microsoft Graph, SharePoint, Exchange, and third-party APIs

- **Advanced Risk Assessment Framework**
  - Multi-factor risk scoring based on privilege level, scope, usage patterns, and application age
  - Detects over-privileged applications violating principle of least privilege
  - Identifies unused applications with dangerous permissions (critical attack vectors)
  - Monitors admin consent compliance and governance violations

- **Enterprise Governance Reporting**
  - Executive security dashboards with permission risk summaries
  - Detailed CSV reports for security team analysis and remediation
  - High-risk permission alerts with professional HTML email templates
  - SOC2/SOX compliance documentation with audit trails

- **Permission Usage Analysis**
  - Cross-references permission grants with actual application usage patterns
  - Identifies shadow IT applications through OAuth consent analysis
  - Tracks permission trends and governance improvements over time
  - Provides business context for permission risk assessment

## üéØ Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Levels

| Risk Level | Criteria | Action Required |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | High-risk app permissions on unused applications | Immediate (24 hours) |
| **High** | Dangerous permissions (Directory.ReadWrite.All, etc.) | Urgent (this week) |
| **Medium** | Broad scope permissions, admin consent violations | Planned (30 days) |
| **Low** | Standard delegated permissions with appropriate scope | Monitor |

### High-Risk Permissions (Default Detection)

- **Directory.ReadWrite.All**: Full directory control
- **User.ReadWrite.All**: Modify any user account
- **Application.ReadWrite.All**: Create/modify applications
- **RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory**: Assign admin roles
- **Sites.FullControl.All**: Complete SharePoint access
- **AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All**: Modify application permissions
- **Device.ReadWrite.All**: Device management control
- **Policy.ReadWrite.All**: Modify organizational policies

### Risk Factors

- **Over-Privileged**: Applications with excessive permissions beyond business needs
- **Unused Application**: No sign-in activity in past 90 days with dangerous permissions
- **Broad Scope**: Permissions with keywords like "All", "ReadWrite", "FullControl"
- **Admin Consent Required**: Permissions requiring admin consent without proper governance
- **Legacy Application**: Applications older than 365 days with powerful permissions
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Extensive access to Microsoft Graph endpoints

| App role assignment errors | Check AppRoleAssignment.Read.All permission |
| Usage analysis fails | Verify AuditLog.Read.All permission and data availability |
| Missing critical permissions in results | Review high-risk permission configuration |

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom High-Risk Permissions
```powershell
$CustomHighRiskPermissions = @(
    "Directory.ReadWrite.All",
    "User.ReadWrite.All",
    "YourCustom.Permission.All"
)

.\Scripts\ApplicationPermissionAuditor.ps1 `
    -HighRiskPermissions $CustomHighRiskPermissions
```
