# Application Permission Auditor

## Overview
The Application Permission Auditor is a critical enterprise security automation that comprehensively analyzes Microsoft Graph API permissions across all Enterprise Applications. This automation addresses one of the most significant security risks in modern Azure environments: over-privileged applications that violate the principle of least privilege and create potential attack vectors for malicious actors.

## Mission Statement
Provide comprehensive visibility into application permission risks, enforce principle of least privilege across enterprise applications, and establish governance frameworks to prevent privilege escalation and data exfiltration through over-privileged applications.

## Core Functionality

### 🔍 Comprehensive Permission Discovery
- **Enterprise Application Scanning**: Discovers all Service Principals across the Azure AD tenant
- **Permission Type Analysis**: Analyzes both Application permissions (app-to-app) and Delegated permissions (user-to-app)
- **OAuth Consent Mapping**: Tracks OAuth2 permission grants with consent type analysis
- **Resource API Coverage**: Identifies permissions across Microsoft Graph, SharePoint, Exchange, and third-party APIs

### 🚨 Advanced Risk Assessment Framework
- **Multi-Factor Risk Scoring**: Evaluates permissions based on privilege level, scope, usage patterns, and application age
- **Risk Categories**:
  - **Critical**: High-risk application permissions on unused applications (highest attack risk)
  - **High**: Dangerous permissions like Directory.ReadWrite.All, User.ReadWrite.All, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory
  - **Medium**: Broad scope permissions, admin consent required permissions, legacy applications
  - **Low**: Standard delegated permissions with appropriate scope

### 📊 Enterprise Governance Reporting
- **Executive Security Dashboards**: High-level permission risk summaries for leadership
- **Detailed Permission Inventories**: Comprehensive CSV reports for security team analysis
- **Compliance Documentation**: SOC2/SOX audit trails with permission governance evidence
- **Risk Trend Analysis**: Historical tracking of permission risk posture improvements

### 🔧 Permission Governance Automation
- **Over-Privilege Detection**: Identifies applications with excessive permissions beyond business needs
- **Usage Correlation**: Cross-references permission grants with actual application usage patterns
- **Admin Consent Monitoring**: Tracks applications requiring admin consent for governance compliance
- **Legacy Application Assessment**: Prioritizes review of older applications with potentially outdated permissions

## Security Architecture

### Permission Requirements
This automation requires the following Microsoft Graph API permissions:
- **Application.Read.All**: Read Enterprise Application and Service Principal objects
- **Directory.Read.All**: Access directory information for comprehensive analysis
- **DelegatedPermissionGrant.Read.All**: Read OAuth2 permission grants (delegated permissions)
- **AppRoleAssignment.Read.All**: Read application role assignments (application permissions)
- **AuditLog.Read.All**: Analyze sign-in patterns to determine application usage
- **Mail.Send**: Send security alerts and governance reports

### Fail-Fast Security Validation
Following enterprise security patterns, the script implements comprehensive permission validation:

```powershell
if (-not $PermissionsValid) {
    $ErrorMessage = @"
CRITICAL ERROR: Missing required Microsoft Graph permissions.

Required permissions:
$(($RequiredPermissions | ForEach-Object { "  - $_" }) -join "`n")

Missing permissions:
$(($MissingPermissions | ForEach-Object { "  - $_" }) -join "`n")

To fix this:
1. Go to Azure Portal → App Registrations → $ClientId
2. Navigate to API Permissions
3. Add the missing Microsoft Graph permissions (Application type)
4. Click 'Grant admin consent'
5. Re-run this script

Cannot proceed safely without proper permissions.
"@
    Write-Error $ErrorMessage
    throw "Missing required Microsoft Graph permissions. Cannot continue safely."
}
```

### Authentication Patterns
- **Production**: Managed Identity authentication (recommended)
- **Testing**: Environment variables (`$env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `$env:AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `$env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- **Never**: Hardcoded credentials (blocked by pre-commit hooks)

## Risk Assessment Algorithm

### Permission Risk Factors
```powershell
# Critical Risk Factors
- High-risk application permissions on unused applications
- Directory.ReadWrite.All, User.ReadWrite.All, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory
- Applications with broad scope permissions not actively used

# High Risk Factors
- Dangerous permissions requiring immediate justification
- Admin consent required permissions without proper governance
- Legacy applications (>365 days) with powerful permissions

# Medium Risk Factors
- Multiple risk factors combined
- Broad scope keywords (All, ReadWrite, FullControl)
- Microsoft Graph API permissions with extensive access

# Low Risk
- Standard delegated permissions with appropriate scope
- Well-managed applications with legitimate business needs
- Recent applications with proper permission justification
```

### Business Impact Assessment
The automation provides business context for each permission risk:
- **Data Exfiltration Risk**: Applications with access to sensitive data repositories
- **Privilege Escalation Risk**: Applications that can modify users, groups, or roles
- **Compliance Violations**: Permissions that violate enterprise governance policies
- **Shadow IT Detection**: Unauthorized applications with dangerous permissions

## Implementation Patterns for AI Agents

### Core Security Patterns
1. **Comprehensive Permission Mapping**: Always analyze both application and delegated permissions
2. **Usage Correlation**: Cross-reference permission grants with actual usage patterns
3. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focus security efforts on unused applications with dangerous permissions
4. **Governance Integration**: Provide clear business justification requirements for high-risk permissions

### Permission Analysis Patterns
```powershell
# Multi-dimensional risk assessment
$RiskFactors = @()
if ($HighRiskPermissions -contains $Permission.Permission) { $RiskFactors += "High-Risk Permission" }
if ($Permission.RequiresAdminConsent) { $RiskFactors += "Admin Consent Required" }
if ($Permission.PermissionType -eq "Application") { $RiskFactors += "Application Permission" }

# Broad scope detection
$BroadScopeKeywords = @("All", "ReadWrite", "FullControl")
foreach ($Keyword in $BroadScopeKeywords) {
    if ($Permission.Permission -like "*$Keyword*") {
        $RiskFactors += "Broad Scope"
        break
    }
}

# Critical risk combinations
if ($Permission.IsHighRisk -and $Permission.PermissionType -eq "Application" -and -not $IsActiveApplication) {
    $Permission.RiskLevel = "Critical"  # Highest security risk
}
```

### OAuth Consent Analysis Patterns
```powershell
# Comprehensive OAuth2 grant analysis
foreach ($Grant in $OAuth2Grants) {
    if ($Grant.Scope) {
        $Scopes = $Grant.Scope -split " " | Where-Object { $_ -ne "" }
        foreach ($Scope in $Scopes) {
            # Analyze each delegated permission scope
            $PermissionScope = $ResourceApp.Oauth2PermissionScopes | Where-Object { $_.Value -eq $Scope }
            
            # Risk assessment based on permission type and consent model
            $RequiresAdminConsent = $PermissionScope.Type -eq "Admin"
            $ConsentType = $Grant.ConsentType  # "AllPrincipals" vs "Principal"
        }
    }
}
```

## Reporting Framework

## Integration Patterns

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
```powershell
# Example: Export high-risk findings to SIEM
$HighRiskPermissions = $PermissionData | Where-Object { $_.RiskLevel -in @("Critical", "High") }
foreach ($Permission in $HighRiskPermissions) {
    $SIEMEvent = @{
        EventType = "HighRiskPermissionDetected"
        ApplicationName = $Permission.ApplicationName
        Permission = $Permission.Permission
        RiskLevel = $Permission.RiskLevel
        RiskFactors = $Permission.RiskFactors
        Timestamp = Get-Date
    }
    # Send to SIEM platform...
}
```

### Governance Integration
- **ServiceNow Integration**: Automated ticket creation for permission review requirements
- **Azure Policy Integration**: Enforce permission governance policies
- **Conditional Access Integration**: Risk-based access control based on application permissions

## Testing Approach

### Comprehensive Permission Testing
The automation includes extensive testing capabilities:
- **Graph API Connectivity**: Validates authentication and basic API access
- **Permission Verification**: Tests each required permission with actual API calls
- **Application Permission Access**: Verifies ability to read app role assignments
- **Delegated Permission Access**: Confirms OAuth2 permission grant analysis capabilities
- **Usage Analysis Testing**: Validates audit log integration for application usage patterns

### Sample Risk Analysis Testing
```powershell
# Test permission risk analysis with real data
$HighRiskPermissions = @("Directory.ReadWrite.All", "User.ReadWrite.All", "Application.ReadWrite.All")
$SampleAnalysis = Test-SamplePermissionAnalysis -HighRiskPermissions $HighRiskPermissions

# Validate risk scoring algorithm
$CriticalFindings = $SampleAnalysis | Where-Object { $_.RiskLevel -eq "Critical" }
$HighRiskFindings = $SampleAnalysis | Where-Object { $_.RiskLevel -eq "High" }
```

## Critical Security Patterns for AI Agents

### Permission Governance Anti-Patterns to Avoid
```powershell
# NEVER ignore high-risk permissions without business justification
if ($Permission.IsHighRisk) {
    # Don't just log - require explicit review and approval
    $RequiresImmediateReview = $true
}

# NEVER allow over-privileged applications without usage validation
if ($Permission.PermissionType -eq "Application" -and -not $IsActiveApplication) {
    # This combination represents critical security risk
    $Permission.RiskLevel = "Critical"
}
```

### Secure Reporting Patterns
```powershell
# Always sanitize sensitive information in reports
$SanitizedReport = $PermissionData | ForEach-Object {
    $_ | Select-Object -Property * -ExcludeProperty ClientSecret, Password, Key
}

# Provide clear remediation guidance
$RecommendedAction = if ($CriticalPermissions.Count -gt 0) { 
    "Immediate Review Required - $($CriticalPermissions.Count) critical permissions found" 
} else { 
    "Continue Monitoring" 
}
```
