## Critical AI Agent Guardrails üö®

### üö® SERVICE-SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT
**CRITICAL: Before working on ANY automation service, AI agents MUST:**
1. **Read `/Service-Name/Documentation/CLAUDE.md` FIRST** - Understand service-specific context and requirements
2. **Update service Claude.md when making changes** - Document modifications, new patterns, lessons learned
3. **Maintain technical accuracy** - Ensure service documentation reflects current implementation
4. **Add AI guidance** - Include new patterns for future AI agents working on the same service

**üìç LOCATION SPECIFICATION:** All service-specific CLAUDE.md files are located in the `/Documentation/` subfolder of each service directory.

### MANDATORY Requirements for ALL Scripts

#### 1. PowerShell 7+ Compatibility
**EVERY new PowerShell script MUST include this validation pattern:**
- `#Requires -Version 7.0` at the top
- `#Requires -Modules` with specific Azure modules needed
- PowerShell compatibility validation function that checks version and modules
- Explicit blocking of Windows PowerShell (Desktop edition)
- Clear installation guidance for missing dependencies

#### 2. Security Validation Patterns
**MANDATORY security controls:**
- **Permission Validation**: Fail-fast validation with `throw` (never `Write-Warning`)
- **Credential Scanning**: Zero tolerance for hardcoded credentials
- **Environment Variables**: Secure testing patterns with `$env:` variables
- **WhatIf Mode**: Safe testing capabilities for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with actionable guidance

#### 3. Azure Timing and Eventual Consistency Patterns üÜï
**CRITICAL: Handle Azure AD and resource timing issues:**
- **Azure AD Group Creation**: Always wait for group propagation before role assignments
- **Service Principal Creation**: Verify object exists before permission grants
- **Role Assignment Retry**: Implement exponential backoff (3 attempts: 5, 10, 20 seconds)
- **Resource Dependencies**: Wait for resource readiness before dependent operations
- **Validation Loops**: Check object existence with timeout (max 120 seconds)

#### 4. Multi-Tenant Support & Targeted Authentication
**For Azure infrastructure scripts:**
- **MANDATORY**: TenantId parameter is required (not optional) to prevent authentication issues
- Add `TenantId` parameter with GUID validation regex and `Mandatory = $true`
- Always use `-TenantId` in `Connect-AzAccount` calls for targeted authentication
- Prevents multi-tenant authentication confusion and guest account issues

## Azure Blob Storage Integration (New!)

### Overview
All Azure Automation runbooks now support direct integration with Azure Blob Storage for centralized report management, compliance archiving, and improved security through managed identity authentication.

### Features
- **Managed Identity Authentication**: Passwordless access with automatic credential rotation
- **Cool Tier Storage**: Automatic cost optimization for archived reports
- **Year/Month Organization**: Reports organized in `yyyy/MM/` folder structure
- **Backward Compatibility**: Scripts continue to write locally when storage not configured

### Container Mapping
Each automation service writes to its own dedicated container:
- **Device Cleanup**: `device-cleanup-reports`
- **MFA Compliance**: `mfa-compliance-reports`
- **Certificate Monitor**: `certificate-reports`
- **App Usage Monitor**: `app-usage-reports`
- **Permission Auditor**: `permission-audit-reports`
- **Service Principal Manager**: `service-principal-reports`

### Security Configuration
- **RBAC Only**: No shared key access enabled
- **Private Endpoints**: Optional VNet integration
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrict to automation account IPs
- **Encryption at Rest**: Azure-managed or customer-managed keys
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2 minimum

## Azure Automation Deployment Workflow (CRITICAL)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY 3-STEP DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE
**ALL Azure Automation deployments MUST follow this exact sequence:**

#### Step 1: Create Deployment Group (MANUAL)
- Creates an Azure AD group with necessary RBAC permissions
- Purpose: Creates security group and assigns it to the resource group with required Azure RBAC roles

#### Step 2: Grant Graph Permissions (MANUAL)
- Grants Microsoft Graph API permissions to the managed identity
- Purpose: Assigns necessary Microsoft Graph permissions for the specific automation task

#### Step 3: Deploy Automation (MANUAL)
- Deploys the runbook to the existing Automation Account
- Purpose: Deploys the actual automation runbook and configures schedules

### Required Permissions by Solution

| Solution | Required Permissions | Purpose |
|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Device Cleanup** | Device.ReadWrite.All, User.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Mail.Send | Device management and notifications |
| **MFA Compliance** | AuditLog.Read.All, User.Read.All, Mail.Send, Directory.Read.All | Audit log analysis and compliance |
| **App Usage Monitor** | Application.Read.All, AuditLog.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Mail.Send | Application usage analysis |
| **App Certificate Monitor** | Application.Read.All, AuditLog.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Mail.Send | Certificate lifecycle monitoring |
| **Service Principal Manager** | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, AuditLog.Read.All, Mail.Send | Credential lifecycle management |
| **Application Permission Auditor** | Application.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, DelegatedPermissionGrant.Read.All, AppRoleAssignment.Read.All, AuditLog.Read.All, Mail.Send | Permission governance |
| **Azure Files Deployment** | Azure RBAC: Storage Account Contributor, Network Contributor, Key Vault Contributor | Infrastructure deployment |

### Key Workflow Principles
1. **Sequential Execution**: Each step depends on the previous one completing successfully
2. **Manual Execution**: All three steps are run manually by an administrator
3. **Shared Infrastructure**: Multiple automations can share the same Automation Account
4. **Least Privilege**: Each automation gets only the permissions it needs
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Azure RBAC (Step 1) is separate from Graph permissions (Step 2)

## Tenant ID Requirement - Critical Authentication Update

### Why This Change is Required
Microsoft requires explicit Tenant ID specification for all Azure and Microsoft Graph authentication to prevent authentication issues, especially with MSA (personal Microsoft) accounts and multi-tenant environments.

### Updated Script Requirements
All scripts now **REQUIRE** the `-TenantId` parameter to prevent:
- "This API is not supported for MSA accounts" errors
- "Failed to get Microsoft Graph service principal" errors
- "Multi-tenant authentication not supported" errors

### Best Practices
1. **Always specify Tenant ID** in production scripts
2. **Store Tenant ID** in secure configuration or Key Vault
3. **Validate Tenant ID format** before authentication attempts
4. **Use organizational accounts** for administrative tasks
5. **Document Tenant ID** in deployment guides

## Security Guidelines and Standards

### Security Measures Implemented
- **Managed Identity Support**: Primary authentication method for production
- **Least Privilege Access**: Scripts request only required permissions
- **Permission Validation**: Runtime verification of required permissions
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All sensitive data sourced from secure stores
- **Encryption at Rest**: All reports and backups stored encrypted
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data collected and retained
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
- **Safety Thresholds**: Built-in limits prevent accidental mass operations
- **WhatIf Mode**: Mandatory testing mode for validation
- **Input Validation**: All parameters validated before processing

### PowerShell Validation Requirements
**Mandatory Pre-Commit Validation:**
1. **Syntax Validation**: Scripts must parse without syntax errors
2. **PSScriptAnalyzer Compliance**: Zero errors, address critical warnings
3. **Error Handling Standards**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
4. **Security Requirements**: ZERO hardcoded credentials, proper SecureString usage
5. **Automated Validation**: All scripts validated before commit with comprehensive checks

### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Accidental mass deletion | Low | High | Safety thresholds, WhatIf mode, exclusion lists |
| Unauthorized access | Low | High | Managed identity, RBAC, audit logging |
| Data exposure | Low | Medium | Encrypted storage, access controls |
| Service disruption | Medium | Medium | Gradual rollout, monitoring, rollback procedures |
| Compliance violations | Low | High | Comprehensive audit trails, retention policies |

### Security Configuration Standards
- **Azure Automation Account**: Automation Contributor role required
- **Managed Identity**: Custom role with specific Graph permissions
- **Storage Account**: Storage Blob Data Contributor for reports
- **Key Vault Integration**: Store sensitive configuration securely
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Configure for runbook failures, high deletion counts, permission errors

## Critical Lessons Learned for AI Agents

### Lesson 1: Permission Validation Must Fail Fast
**CRITICAL SECURITY PATTERN**: Never use `Write-Warning` for missing permissions - always use `throw` to stop execution immediately. This prevents:
- False success indicators
- Hidden security failures
- Poor error messages
- Security risks from insufficient authorization
- Operational risks from incomplete automation

### Lesson 2: Azure Automation Accounts vs Infrastructure Deployment
**KEY DISTINCTION**:
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: Use Service Principal with Azure RBAC, no Automation Account needed
- **Runtime Operations**: Use Automation Account + Managed Identity for scheduled automation
- **When to Use Automation Accounts**: Scheduled automation, unattended execution, Graph API access, email notifications
- **When NOT to Use**: Infrastructure deployment, one-time setup, user-initiated deployments

### Lesson 3: Azure Storage Security Layers
**MULTIPLE PUBLIC ACCESS CONTROLS**:
- **Public Network Access**: Controls internet connections (Enabled/Disabled)
- **Blob Public Access**: Controls anonymous access (should be $false)
- **Network Access Rules**: Controls which networks can access storage
- **Secure Configuration**: PublicNetworkAccess = 'Enabled' + AllowBlobPublicAccess = $false + Network rules

### Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Permission Validation**: Never use `Write-Warning` for missing permissions - always `throw`
- **Global Admin Dependency**: Create least-privilege groups instead of requiring Global Admin
- **Legacy Device Management**: Use Intune configuration profiles, NOT net use commands
- **Service Principal Confusion**: Clearly document when automation is needed vs manual deployment
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Zero tolerance - implement comprehensive scanning
- **Azure Timing Issues**: Never assume immediate availability of Azure AD objects or role assignments
- **No Retry Logic**: Always implement retry with backoff for Azure AD operations
- **Ignoring Eventual Consistency**: Azure AD operations require propagation time - validate before proceeding
- **Public Access Security Gap**: NEVER leave Azure resources with unrestricted public access after deployment

### Established Success Patterns
- **Infrastructure Security**: Implement security-first design with enterprise controls
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Add TenantId parameter while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Group-Based Permissions**: Provision dedicated Azure AD groups with scoped access
- **Modern Device Management**: Integrate with Intune using Administrative Templates
- **Clear Authentication Guidance**: Document OAuth vs Service Principal scenarios
- **Azure Timing Resilience**: Implement wait/retry patterns for Azure AD eventual consistency
- **Propagation Validation**: Verify object existence before dependent operations
- **Graceful Failure Handling**: Provide manual commands when automatic retry fails
- **Secure Infrastructure Deployment**: Always restrict public access after resource provisioning
