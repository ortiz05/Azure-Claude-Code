## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Sign-In Log Analysis Logic
The automation should follow this analysis workflow:
1. Query Azure AD sign-in logs for specified date range
2. Filter for interactive user sign-ins with MFA requirement
3. Extract authentication methods used for each sign-in
4. Categorize methods as compliant (Microsoft Authenticator) vs non-compliant
5. Group results by user and calculate compliance metrics
6. Generate detailed records for reporting and notifications

### 2. MFA Method Classification
**Compliant Methods (Microsoft Authenticator Only):**
- microsoftAuthenticatorPush
- microsoftAuthenticatorOTP

**Non-Compliant Methods:**
- sms (SMS Text Message)
- voice (Voice Call)
- email (Email)
- softwareOath (Software OATH Token)
- fido2 (FIDO2 Security Key)
- windowsHelloForBusiness (Windows Hello)
- certificate (Certificate-based Authentication)
- oath (OATH Hardware Token)

### 3. Email Notification Design
**User Notification Requirements:**
- Professional HTML design with security branding
- Clear subject line indicating security alert and action required
- Detailed table showing:
  - Date and time of non-compliant sign-ins
  - Device/browser information
  - MFA method used
  - Geographic location
- Step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring Microsoft Authenticator
- Clear compliance deadline (recommend 7 days)
- Contact information for IT support
- Educational content about security benefits of Microsoft Authenticator

**Admin Summary Requirements:**
- Executive dashboard format with key metrics
- Compliance rate calculations and trends
- Top 10 non-compliant users with details
- Most common non-compliant methods analysis
- Processing errors and technical issues
- Actionable recommendations for improving compliance

### 4. Reporting and Analytics
**CSV Report Types:**
1. **Non-Compliant Users Report**
   - User identification and contact information
   - Count of non-compliant sign-ins
   - Methods used and frequency
   - Last non-compliant sign-in date
   - Notification delivery status

2. **Detailed Sign-In Analysis**
   - Individual sign-in records for non-compliant users
   - Device and location information
   - Method-specific details
   - Risk assessment data

3. **Compliance Summary**
   - Overall compliance statistics
   - Trend analysis over time
   - Method usage patterns
   - Organizational compliance metrics

4. **Processing Errors**
   - Failed operations and reasons
   - User processing issues
   - System errors and resolutions

### Azure Blob Storage Integration (NEW)
**Centralized Report Management:**
- **Container**: `mfa-compliance-reports` (dedicated container for MFA compliance)
- **Organization**: Reports stored in `yyyy/MM/` folder structure for audit compliance
- **Cost Optimization**: Cool tier storage for long-term retention
- **Security**: Managed identity authentication with no hardcoded credentials
- **Parameters**:
  - `StorageAccountName`: Azure Storage account for report archival
  - `StorageContainerName`: Default "mfa-compliance-reports"
  - `UseManagedIdentity`: Default true for secure authentication
- **Compliance Benefits**: Centralized audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Backward Compatibility**: Local exports continue when storage not configured

### 5. Security and Compliance Controls
**Authentication Security:**
- Use managed identity for production deployments
- Validate all required permissions before execution
- Implement secure error handling without credential exposure
- Support emergency access account exclusions

**Data Protection:**
- Encrypt all report files at rest
- Implement data retention policies
- Secure handling of user personal information
- Audit trail generation for all operations

**Operational Security:**
- User exclusion lists for service accounts and emergency access
- WhatIf mode for testing and validation
- Safety thresholds to prevent mass email sending
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring integration
