# Enterprise Application Certificate Monitor

Critical security automation for identifying unused Enterprise Applications with expired certificates and secrets.

## üìã Overview

This automation combines two high-risk security indicators: applications that haven't been used in 90+ days AND have expired certificates or secrets. This combination represents a critical security vulnerability that requires immediate attention.

## üö® Critical Security Focus

**Why This Matters:**
- Unused applications with expired credentials are prime targets for attackers
- Expired certificates may indicate abandoned or compromised applications
- These applications often retain dangerous permissions despite being inactive
- Regulatory compliance requires proper certificate lifecycle management

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Dual Risk Detection**
  - Identifies applications unused for 90+ days
  - Analyzes certificate and secret expiration status
  - Combines usage and certificate data for comprehensive risk assessment

- **Critical Security Alerting**
  - Immediate high-priority alerts for critical findings
  - Separate notification channels for security teams
  - Executive escalation for high-risk scenarios

- **Comprehensive Certificate Analysis**
  - Tracks both X.509 certificates and client secrets
  - Monitors expiration timelines and grace periods
  - Identifies applications with multiple expired credentials

- **Risk-Based Prioritization**
  - Critical: Unused apps with expired credentials
  - High: Apps with expired credentials (regardless of usage)
  - Medium: Unused apps with soon-to-expire credentials

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Required Permissions**
   - Application.Read.All (to read app credentials)
   - AuditLog.Read.All (to read sign-in logs)
   - Directory.Read.All (for directory access)
   - Mail.Send (for critical alerts)

2. **PowerShell Modules**
   ```powershell
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

### Basic Usage

```powershell
# Critical security scan
.\Scripts\EnterpriseAppCertificateMonitor.ps1 `
    -DaysUnused 90 `
    -SecurityAdminEmails @("security@company.com") `
    -ITAdminEmails @("admin@company.com") `
    -SendCriticalAlerts
```

## üìä Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| DaysUnused | Int | 90 | Days without usage threshold |
| WhatIf | Switch | False | Simulation mode |
| ITAdminEmails | String[] | [] | IT admin emails for reports |
| SecurityAdminEmails | String[] | [] | Security team emails for critical alerts |
| ExcludedApps | String[] | [] | Apps to exclude from analysis |
| ExportPath | String | C:\EnterpriseAppCertificateReports | Report output path |
| IncludeSoonToExpire | Switch | True | Include certificates expiring soon |
| CertificateExpiryWarningDays | Int | 30 | Days before expiration to warn |
| SendCriticalAlerts | Switch | True | Enable critical security alerts |

## üö® Risk Categories

### Critical Risk (Immediate Action Required)
- **Criteria**: Unused 90+ days AND expired certificates/secrets
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized access through dormant applications
- **Action**: Remove or disable immediately

### High Risk (This Week)
- **Criteria**: Expired certificates/secrets (regardless of usage)
- **Impact**: Authentication failures and potential security issues
- **Action**: Renew certificates or remove applications

### Medium Risk (This Month)
- **Criteria**: Unused apps with soon-to-expire certificates
- **Impact**: Pending authentication issues
- **Action**: Evaluate necessity and renew or remove

## üìß Alert System

### Critical Security Alerts
Sent immediately to security teams when critical applications are found:

- **Subject**: "üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT: [X] Apps with Expired Credentials"
- **Priority**: High
- **Recipients**: Security administrators
- **Content**: Detailed table of critical applications with action items

### Detailed Reports
Comprehensive analysis sent to IT administrators:

- **Subject**: "üîê Enterprise App Certificate Report - [X] Critical Issues"
- **Priority**: Normal/High (based on findings)
- **Recipients**: IT administrators
- **Content**: Full analysis with recommendations and security impact

## üîç Certificate Analysis Details

### Monitored Credential Types
- **X.509 Certificates**: Used for authentication and signing
- **Client Secrets**: Password-based authentication credentials
- **Key Credentials**: Asymmetric key pairs for authentication

### Expiration Tracking
- **Expired**: Credentials past their expiration date
- **Expiring Soon**: Credentials expiring within warning period (default: 30 days)
- **Valid**: Credentials with future expiration dates

### Risk Factors Analyzed
- **Permission Level**: Application vs. delegated permissions
- **Publisher Trust**: Microsoft vs. third-party applications
- **Usage Patterns**: Recent activity and user engagement
- **Credential Age**: Time since credential creation/renewal
